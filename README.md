# Node.JS + MySQL Web App.<br><br>HELM deployment and upgrading the app on a Kubernetes cluster launched on MS Azure AKS.

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> This is a part of a series of demo projects in which I manipulate a Node.js application using various technologies.<br>
>
> The app built using Node.js and Express, originally presented at this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/otam-mato/nodejs_mysql_web_app_terraform.git). The previous [project](https://github.com/otam-mato/nodejs_mysql_web_app_docker.git) involved the "Canary" deployment on **AWS EKS**.
>
> In the current installment, we're deploying the web application on **MS Azure AKS** using **HELM**. Subsequently, we'll introduce the second version of the app and then rollback to the first version with HELM.
